# Coca Cola System!

Hi there!
In this repository I present a short code that I made a long time ago while I was learning Java. This project consist in a GUI for Coca Cola Workerks, it contains a login and main interface.

## How it does?
This code offers a Graphic User Interface for Coca Cola Workers, it provides a login interface along with a main interface. This main interface calculates the vacation period for workers based on their worker 
seniority. 

## How to run it?
You only need to download the .zip and have installed Java. It is NOT necessary the JDK.
