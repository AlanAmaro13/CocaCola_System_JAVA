# Coca Cola GUI System!

Hi there!
In this repository I present a short code that I made a long time ago while I was learning Java. This project consist in a GUI for Coca Cola Workerks, it contains a login, T&C, and main interface.

## How it does?
This code offers a Graphic User Interface for Coca Cola Workers, it provides a login interface along with a main interface. This main interface calculates the vacation period for workers based on their worker seniority. 

## How was it coded?
The code is based on three main sections:

1. Bienvenida: This class offers a login interface.

3. Principal: This class presents the GUI for workers

5. Terminos: This class contains the Terms & Conditions
![terms](https://github.com/AlanAmaro13/CocaCola_System_JAVA/blob/main/images/terms.png)

These sections are shown in the code version (.java) and the compilated version (.class) 


## How to run it?
You only need to download the .zip and have installed Java. It is NOT necessary the JDK.
