# Coca Cola GUI System!

Hi there!
In this repository I present a short code that I made a long time ago while I was learning Java. This project consist in a GUI for Coca Cola Workerks, it contains a login, T&C, and main interface.

## What it does?
This code offers a Graphic User Interface for Coca Cola Workers, it provides a login interface along with a main interface. This main interface calculates the vacation period for workers based on their worker seniority. 

## How was it coded?
The code is based on three main sections:

1. Bienvenida: This class offers a login interface where you write your name.

3. Principal: This class presents the GUI for workers, in this section you add your job positions, seniority. It allows you to change the interface's color.

5. Terminos: This class contains the Terms & Conditions.

These sections are shown in the code version (.java) and the compilated version (.class)


## How to run it?
You only need to download the .zip and have installed Java. You unzip the document and run the program!

It is NOT necessary to install the JDK.
